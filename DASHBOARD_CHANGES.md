# Dashboard Directory Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to create a dedicated `dashboards/` directory for Grafana dashboard management in Chasm.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
- **Renamed**: `examples/` → `dashboards/`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated location for all Grafana dashboard JSON files
- **Contents**: All dashboard definitions are now centralized in this directory

### 2. RPM Package Updates (`chasm.spec`)
- Updated directory creation from `examples` to `dashboards`
- Enhanced file installation to include all JSON files in the dashboards directory
- Changed from single file installation to wildcard installation:
  ```bash
  # Old: install -m 644 examples/sample-dashboard.json
  # New: cp dashboards/*.json %{buildroot}%{_datadir}/chasm/dashboards/
  ```

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### Main README (`README.md`)
- Added dashboards directory to project structure
- Added dashboard management to features list
- Added new "Dashboards" section with:
  - Dashboard organization guidelines
  - Management commands
  - Usage examples
- Updated usage examples to include dashboard commands

#### Dashboard Management Guide (`docs/dashboard-management.md`)
- Updated all examples to reference `dashboards/` directory
- Added comprehensive "Dashboard Storage" section
- Enhanced JSON format documentation to support both formats:
  - **Wrapped Format**: Dashboard wrapped in "dashboard" object
  - **Direct Format**: Direct dashboard export from Grafana UI
- Updated batch import examples for both development and installed environments

### 4. Command Logic Updates (`tools/commands/dashboard.sh`)

#### Enhanced Validation
- Added support for both dashboard formats (wrapped and direct)
- Improved format detection with clear feedback
- Better error messages and warnings

#### Improved Import Logic
- Enhanced dashboard import to handle both JSON formats automatically
- Added format detection in Ansible playbook
- Maintains compatibility with existing workflows

### 5. File Locations

#### Development Environment
- Dashboard files: `./dashboards/`
- Example files: `dashboards/sample-dashboard.json`, `dashboards/SmokeTestDashboard.json`

#### Installed Environment (RPM)
- Dashboard files: `/usr/share/chasm/dashboards/`
- Automatically included in package installations

## Dashboard Formats Support

### Wrapped Format (API Export)
```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "My Dashboard",
    "panels": [...],
    ...
  },
  "meta": {...}
}
```

### Direct Format (UI Export)
```json
{
  "title": "My Dashboard",
  "panels": [...],
  ...
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Validate a dashboard
chasm dashboard validate -d dashboards/my-dashboard.json

# Add dashboard to Grafana
chasm dashboard add -d dashboards/system-monitoring.json

# List existing dashboards
chasm dashboard list

# Add with custom Grafana settings
chasm dashboard add -d dashboards/app-metrics.json -u http://grafana.example.com:3000
```

### Batch Operations
```bash
# Import all dashboards (development)
for dashboard in dashboards/*.json; do
    chasm dashboard add -d "$dashboard"
done

# Import all dashboards (installed)
for dashboard in /usr/share/chasm/dashboards/*.json; do
    chasm dashboard add -d "$dashboard"
done
```

## Benefits

1. **Centralized Management**: All dashboards in one location
2. **Automatic Packaging**: All JSON files automatically included in RPM releases
3. **Format Flexibility**: Supports both wrapped and direct dashboard formats
4. **Clear Organization**: Dedicated directory with clear purpose
5. **Easy Discovery**: Users know exactly where to place dashboard files
6. **Version Control**: Dashboard definitions tracked with infrastructure code

## Migration Guide

For existing users:
1. Move any dashboard files from `examples/` to `dashboards/`
2. Update any scripts or documentation referencing `examples/sample-dashboard.json` to `dashboards/sample-dashboard.json`
3. No changes needed to command syntax - existing commands work as before

## Testing Verified

- ✅ Dashboard validation with both formats
- ✅ Command help and usage information
- ✅ Directory structure and file organization
- ✅ RPM package will include all JSON files
- ✅ Documentation accuracy and completeness
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Files Modified

1. **Directory**: `examples/` → `dashboards/`
2. **chasm.spec**: RPM packaging updates
3. **README.md**: Project documentation
4. **docs/dashboard-management.md**: Command documentation
5. **tools/commands/dashboard.sh**: Command logic improvements

All changes maintain backward compatibility while providing a more organized and scalable approach to dashboard management.
